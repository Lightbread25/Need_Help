Count disribution ISSUE HAS BEEN FOUND AND FIXED, I think I mistyped an extra h in the CVE

I am expriencing high bias for 0.2 - 0.4 redshift bin in the power spectrum than the one obtained by sim data
Other bins are somewhat ok, but also theory is slightly higher than observed


so now for example: 40% sky for M200m > 1e14 h^-1 M_sun

redshift bin from 0.2 to 2
Observerd: 56603 
Expected: 57989
E/O ratio: 1.0244863346465736
Difference = 1386.0


redshift bin from 0.2 to 0.4
Observerd: 9863 
Expected: 9679 
E/O ratio: 0.9812430295042076
Difference = 184

redshift bin from 0.4 to 0.6
Observerd: 13948  
Expected: 13838
E/O ration: 0.9921135646687698
Difference = -110.0

redshift bin from 0.6 to 0.8
Observerd: 12685    
Expected: 12984.0
E/O ration: 1.023571147024044
Difference = 299.0 

redshift bin from 0.8 to 1.0
Observerd: 9305    
Expected: 9575.0
E/O ration: 1.0290166577109081
Difference = 270.0
